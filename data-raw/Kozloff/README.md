## Kozloff data

* The file `List of marine invertebrates from Eugene Kozloff.xlsx` was
  downloaded on July 5th, 2017 from
  https://www.eopugetsound.org/species/custom-lists/307
* This file has been edited by Gustav Paulay (and saved as
  `GP_kozloff_edits.csv`), to fix misspelling and changes in genus assignments
  to increase the number of taxa that will match to WoRMS. Additionally, notes
  about the type locality of some of the species has been added. The habitat of
  some species was noted (mostly deep-sea taxa). Notes about changes to spelling
  or genus assignments have been indicated. Some abbreviations used:
  - syn: synonym
  - WoRMS: world registry of marine species (marinespecies.org)
  - ITIS: integrated taxonomic information system (itis.gov)
  - eop: Encyclopedia of the Puget Sound (original source of the digitized
    version of the kozloff list)
